986,2015-08-01,470,Woodhaven Blvd SBS,"The Woodhaven Boulevard SBS capital project will bring Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) treatments to Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards in Queens. Along Woodhaven Boulevard and Cross Bay Boulevard north of 165th Avenue, the project will involve a full roadway reconstruction, excluding the bridges along the corridor, which will only be resurfaced with updated roadway markings. Targeted bus priority measures will also be constructed on Hoffman Drive between Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard and on the north side of Queens Boulevard between Woodhaven Boulevard and 57th Avenue. On Woodhaven Boulevard between Queens Boulevard and Rockaway Avenue, this reconstruction will include implementing a multi-lane boulevard design featuring dedicated bus lanes identified with red coloring and overhead signage, as well as new bus stops located along the medians, with new street furniture, ticket vending machines, and pedestrian wayfinding with real time bus arrival information screens.
